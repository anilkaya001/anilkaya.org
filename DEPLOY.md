# Cloudflare deployment and rollback runbook

This repository targets a Cloudflare Worker named `anilkaya` with Static
Assets, D1 database binding `DB` (`iewt`), and Google OAuth. Repository state
does not prove the current Workers Builds configuration, secrets, routes,
custom domains, remote D1 schema, or staging state; verify those in the target
account before deploying.

## 1. Verify the exact source revision

Work from a clean commit, not an uncommitted directory:

```bash
git status --short --branch
git rev-parse HEAD
```

Record the SHA in the release/change log. Do not deploy if unrelated or
unreviewed files are present.

## 2. Install the pinned toolchain and run every gate

Node.js 22 or newer is required by the committed test toolchain.

```bash
cd tests
npm ci
npx playwright install chromium
npm test
cd ..

./tests/node_modules/.bin/wrangler deploy \
  --dry-run \
  --outdir /tmp/anilkaya-worker-dry-run
```

The tests run contracts, the actual local Worker/asset router with D1, and
Playwright across every course stage. The dry-run validates `wrangler.toml`,
bundles `worker.js`, and checks bindings without uploading.

## 3. Verify D1 deliberately

The checked-in schema defines `users`, `progress`, and `stats`:

```bash
# Disposable/local verification
./tests/node_modules/.bin/wrangler d1 execute iewt \
  --local --file schema.sql

# Remote inspection (authenticated, read-only query). This returns every
# column's position, type, nullability, default, and primary-key ordinal.
./tests/node_modules/.bin/wrangler d1 execute iewt \
  --remote --command \
  "SELECT 'users' AS table_name,cid,name,type,\"notnull\",dflt_value,pk FROM pragma_table_info('users') UNION ALL SELECT 'progress',cid,name,type,\"notnull\",dflt_value,pk FROM pragma_table_info('progress') UNION ALL SELECT 'stats',cid,name,type,\"notnull\",dflt_value,pk FROM pragma_table_info('stats') ORDER BY table_name,cid"
```

Compare the result with `schema.sql`, including column order/type, `NOT NULL`,
defaults, and primary-key ordinals. The required keys are `users.id` = 1,
`progress.user_id` = 1 plus `progress.model_id` = 2, and `stats.user_id` = 1;
all other `pk` values are 0. A table-name-only check is insufficient.

Only if the remote inspection proves a whole table is absent, apply the
idempotent schema intentionally:

```bash
./tests/node_modules/.bin/wrangler d1 execute iewt \
  --remote --file schema.sql
```

Remote D1 writes are production mutations. Capture an export/backup according
to the account's retention policy before non-idempotent future migrations. If
an existing table's columns or keys differ, `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot
repair it; stop and author a reviewed migration instead.

## 4. Verify bindings and secrets

`wrangler.toml` must resolve:

- Worker name: `anilkaya`
- Static binding: `ASSETS`
- D1 binding: `DB` → database `iewt`
- `run_worker_first = true`
- `html_handling = "auto-trailing-slash"`

Required secret bindings:

```text
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
SESSION_SECRET
```

Use Cloudflare secret bindings, not committed values:

```bash
./tests/node_modules/.bin/wrangler secret list
./tests/node_modules/.bin/wrangler secret put GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
./tests/node_modules/.bin/wrangler secret put GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
./tests/node_modules/.bin/wrangler secret put SESSION_SECRET
```

The Google OAuth client must contain the exact production callback:

```text
https://anilkaya.org/auth/callback
```

Add any preview/staging callback separately; never reuse an unverified URL.

## 5. Choose one deployment owner

Do not run two independent production pipelines.

### Recommended: CI-gated deployment

Deploy only after the GitHub `regression` job succeeds for the exact SHA. If
deployment is moved into GitHub Actions, use a least-privilege Cloudflare token
and make the deploy job depend on the test job.

### Cloudflare Workers Builds

If Workers Builds remains the deployment owner, verify in the dashboard:

- repository and production branch;
- root directory;
- pinned install/build commands that execute the committed tests;
- deploy command using the committed Wrangler version;
- preview/staging behavior;
- failure behavior (a failed test must prevent deploy).

An external Worker build can otherwise race GitHub Actions. Repository CI being
green does not by itself prove that Workers Builds waited for it.

For an intentional authenticated manual release after all gates:

```bash
./tests/node_modules/.bin/wrangler deploy --strict
```

`--strict` prevents silently overwriting conflicting remote changes. Record the
resulting version/deployment identifier.

## 6. Verify routes and dashboard response rules

The apex custom domain should route to Worker `anilkaya`. As observed on
2026-07-12, `www.anilkaya.org` still used GitHub Pages to redirect to the apex.
Keep `CNAME` until `www` is explicitly attached to the Worker and its redirect
is verified.

Before this repair, live response headers differed from `worker.js`, consistent
with a dashboard Transform Rule. Inspect **Rules → Transform Rules → Modify
Response Header** and remove or align any rule that overrides CSP,
`X-Frame-Options`, COOP, or cache policy.

## 7. Production smoke tests

Run these against the deployed SHA before declaring success.

### API and security contract

```bash
curl -fsS -D /tmp/api.headers https://anilkaya.org/api/me \
  -o /tmp/api.json
python3 -m json.tool /tmp/api.json
grep -i '^cache-control: no-store' /tmp/api.headers
grep -i '^x-frame-options: DENY' /tmp/api.headers
grep -i '^cross-origin-opener-policy: same-origin' /tmp/api.headers
```

Signed-out `/api/me` must be `200` JSON with `user: null`. Protected endpoints
must return structured JSON 401, not HTML or plain text.

### Canonical course metadata

```bash
curl -fsSI 'https://anilkaya.org/lab/course?m=ols'
curl -fsS 'https://anilkaya.org/lab/ordinary-least-squares/' \
  -o /tmp/course.html
grep -F '<title>Ordinary Least Squares — Econometrics Lab</title>' /tmp/course.html
grep -F 'https://anilkaya.org/lab/ordinary-least-squares/' /tmp/course.html
grep -F '<h1>Ordinary Least Squares</h1>' /tmp/course.html
grep -F 'id="courseStructuredData"' /tmp/course.html
```

The legacy URL must return 308 to the clean course path. Repeat metadata and
crawlable-outline checks for all seven course paths when SEO code changes.

### Cache and encoding invariant

```bash
curl --compressed --fail --silent --show-error \
  -D /tmp/css.headers \
  'https://anilkaya.org/assets/css/base.css?v=18' \
  -o /tmp/base.css
cmp /tmp/base.css assets/css/base.css
grep -i '^cache-control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable' /tmp/css.headers

curl -fsSI https://anilkaya.org/ | grep -i '^cache-control: no-cache'
```

Any byte mismatch or decoding error is a release blocker. Do not “fix” it by
rebuilding an asset response from a plain init dictionary; the finalizer must
retain `new Response(response.body, response)`.

### Domain behavior

```bash
curl -fsSI https://anilkaya.org/
curl -fsSI https://www.anilkaya.org/
```

Confirm the intended apex and `www` ownership rather than assuming DNS or Pages
state from repository files.

## 8. Manual functional checks

1. Open `/lab/`, sign in with Google, and confirm the callback returns to the
   Lab with the correct account.
2. Complete one read, code, interactive, and authored-question stage.
3. Reload and verify no duplicate points.
4. Open another browser/device, sign in, and confirm progress unions rather than
   replacing either device's completed stages.
5. Verify a broken streak can reset on a newer date and an older delayed write
   cannot restore stale state.
6. Inspect D1 rows for the test account; do not expose email/session values in
   logs or screenshots.

## 9. Rollback

List versions and roll back to the last verified version:

```bash
./tests/node_modules/.bin/wrangler versions list
./tests/node_modules/.bin/wrangler rollback <VERIFIED_VERSION_ID>
```

After rollback, rerun the API, course metadata, cache, encoding, auth, and D1
smoke tests. A code rollback does not automatically undo D1 data migrations or
dashboard Transform Rules; treat those as separate rollback items.
